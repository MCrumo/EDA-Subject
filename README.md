>Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains the code developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms subject in the Computer Engineering degree. The subject focuses on studying the most suitable and efficient data structures and algorithms for each situation. In order to apply these concepts, we developed an AI to win the game Pandemic. This algorithms are `Backtracking`, `Divide and Conquer`, `DFS`, `BFS`, `Dijkstra`...

## Project Structure

-   `/Game`: This directory contains the code for the Pandemic game, which was provided by the subject professors. The game is implemented in C++ and the source code can be found at [https://jutge.org/problems/P41108_en/statement](https://jutge.org/problems/P41108_en/statement).
 -   `/Game/IAprogram.cc`: This directory contains the code for the AI implemented to win the Pandemic game. The AI uses various algorithms, such as DFS or Dijkstra, to select the best moves and win the game.
## Visualization
A brief visualzation of the game can be seen. Each color represents a color and its a pvp 4vs4 game with 200 rounds. 
To see more information, take a look at `/Game/GameRules.pdf`
